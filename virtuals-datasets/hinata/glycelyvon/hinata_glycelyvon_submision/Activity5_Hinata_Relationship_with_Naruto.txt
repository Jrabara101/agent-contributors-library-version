275	"Shortly after getting married, Naruto and Hinata had a son and two years later they had a daughter."
276	"Years later, Kakashi stepped down as the Sixth Hokage with Naruto becoming the Seventh upon his recommendation."
277	"Hinata can be seen visiting Neji's grave with her daughter, Himawari."
278	"At the Hokage headquarters, Naruto is informed about his son's prank on the Hokage Monument."
279	"Appearing next to Boruto, he lectures him for doing pranks, explaining and apologizing to him why he couldn't be there for him as the whole village is his family, with this also including Boruto, and as a ninja it is his duty to endure."
280	"When Sarada finds out that Naruto, the seventh Hokage, was going to meet with her father, Sasuke, Sarada decided to follow Naruto along with Chocho, in hopes of finally meeting her father."
281	"After the Hokage left, Boruto soon arrived with Mitsuki and a lunch prepared by Hinata, the Hokage's wife, for his trip."
282	"After Shikamaru told them the Hokage had already left, Boruto decided to leave it at that, until Sarada offered to take it to Naruto."
283	"While Boruto found the idea is pointless, Sarada tells him how important this bento was since it was made by someone who loves the Hokage."
284	"Seeing the determination in her eyes, Boruto agreed to let her take the lunch to his father."
285	"When Naruto is unable to attend Himawari's birthday party due to work and sent a shadow clone as a stand-in, which ended up dropping the birthday cake, Boruto, enraged at his father for missing his own daughter's birthday party, vented his anger to his mother, Hinata."
286	"Admitting that she also missed Naruto and wanted him to be home more often, she however defends Naruto when Boruto started bad talking about him, causing Boruto more anger to the point where he threw Naruto's old jacket out of the window in a fit of rage."
287	"During the third round, Hinata sat in the audience with Himawari."
288	"Upon seeing Hinata and Himawari, Naruto comments to himself how he would prefer to sit with them rather than with the four other Kages."
289	"They watched as Boruto fought Shikadai and seemingly won, making both Naruto and Hinata proud."
290	However this is quickly short-lived once Naruto suspected Boruto of cheating.
291	"Asking Hinata to use her Byakugan on Boruto, she confirmed his suspicions, leaving both disappointed in their son."
292	"Jumping into the arena, Naruto confronted Boruto and disqualified him for cheating, with Hinata hugging Himawari when the young girl asked if Boruto did something wrong."
293	"When Momoshiki and Kinshiki appeared and attacked everyone, Naruto defends his son and teams up with Sasuke to fight them, with Hinata fleeing with Himawari into a safety zone, continuing to stay in the arena out of concern for both her husband and son."
294	"When Naruto jumped in front of Momoshiki's jutsu to protect Boruto, Sasuke, and Sarada, Hinata tried to save him but failed and was left injured in the process."
295	"After being healed by Sakura, Hinata began to panic at the possibility that Naruto was dead, but is quickly reassured by Sasuke who states that Naruto was alive and in another dimension."
296	"She comforts her daughter, Himawari, when asked about her father's fate, also refusing to allow Boruto to go with Sasuke and the other Kage in their mission to rescue Naruto, afraid of the possibility that he would get killed by Momoshiki and Kinshiki."
297	"But upon seeing Boruto wearing Naruto's old jacket, Hinata is reminded of Naruto when he was younger, deciding to finally put her trust in her son."
298	"After the fighting ended, Hinata and Himawari bid farewell to Naruto and Boruto as they both left for work and missions respectively."
299	"Though the Naruto franchise is, at its core, about shinobi overcoming their differences to save the world, it also features a healthy dose of romance."
300	The title character ends up with former classmate Hinata Hyuga after she had a crush on him all through her formative years.
301	"Naruto didn't initially realize the depth of her feelings, but he probably should have since their affection for each other actually helped them both stand up to their enemies more than once."
302	"While Naruto and Hinata's relationship is sometimes overlooked as a result of the fan focus on Naruto's bond with Sasuke, there are a lot of positive aspects of their relationship to consider."
303	"Naruto and Hinata make a great fit, and these instances in the franchise demonstrate that."
304	Hinata Has Unparalleled Faith In Naruto's Abilities
305	"While Naruto eventually becomes an incredibly powerful shinobi, he doesn't start his journey that way."
306	Not all of his strength is a result of the Nine-Tailed Fox inside of him; it takes a lot of hard work and dedication to learning new skills.
307	Hinata sees that in him early and tells him so often.
308	"She has complete faith in his abilities, even when he's still the immature ""knucklehead"" he terms himself to be."
309	"He might be making mistakes and saying the wrong thing, but Hinata never hesitates to stand beside him in a confrontation when they're assigned to the same team in filler episodes."
310	Naruto Inspires Hinata To Be A Better Shinobi
311	"Because of her immense faith in Naruto, Hinata commits to being a stronger shinobi herself."
312	"She sees that Naruto is someone who never backs down and always gives his all, so she decides to do that as well, despite no one else thinking she's cut out for it."
313	"Naruto's inspiration leads to Hinata learning more and more impressive skills, even eventually creating her own jutsu in the anime with her Byakugan skills."
314	Naruto Encourages Hinata To Stand Up For Herself
315	"Even when Hinata has difficulty holding a conversation with him, Naruto still tries to encourage her."
316	"This doesn't always lead to great results, but his heart is in the right place."
317	"When everyone doubts whether she can last in a fight against Neji in the Chunin Exams, Naruto is the only one who encourages her to keep going."
318	"He doesn't know the full extent of the damage Neji does at the start of the fight, so his encouragement is founded in his belief that everyone should have someone in their corner, not in Hinata having to engage in an impossible fight."
319	Hinata Is Always Willing To Offer Him A Helping Hand
320	Naruto tends to jump into situations without thinking and just keep going while he's injured.
321	"During the Chunin Exams, for example, she offers up her own homemade ointment to help him with his injuries, despite not even being able to get the words out to explain that she wants to help him."
322	"Years later, when the two work together in The Last: Naruto The Movie, she's still there to help him recover from injuries as they're able to get to know one another better."
323	"While Hinata doesn't spend as much time there as a teenager as he does, there is a fun moment in Boruto that indicates she loves ramen as much as her future husband."
324	She's got a plaque on the wall denoting her as the Queen of Gluttony for a record-breaking consumption of ramen in a single visit.
325	"Considering how different Hinata and Naruto are outside of their commitment to becoming better shinobi, it's nice that they still have some things in common."
326	"Naruto Doesn't Care That She's ""Weird"""
327	Hinata's fainting spells around Naruto are sometimes described as weird.
328	So is her inability to speak full sentences to him.
329	"Most of the time, it's Naruto himself who makes that assessment."
330	"When coming across Hinata while she's training one day, however, Naruto decides that he likes her weirdness and considers her a friend."
331	They Back Each Other Up In The Most Dangerous Of Fights
332	A lot of the most dangerous fights in the anime occur while Naruto and his peers are still working their way up the shinobi ladder.
333	One of the best showcases of their willingness to back each other up in a dangerous setting is when Pain comes to Konoha.
334	"Pain pretty quickly gets the better of Naruto, and though other shinobi are terrified of taking the Akatsuki leader on, Hinata blocks Pain's path to Naruto in order to defend him."
335	"She doesn't last long in a fight, but her taking on Pain herself  and Naruto believing Pain kills her  is what motivates him to tap into the tailed beast inside him and completely wreck the village."
336	"Everything is set right eventually, but this fight makes it clear just how much the two care about one another."
337	Naruto's Scarf Is Their Red String Of Fate
338	Multiple Eastern Asian cultures have variations of the legend of the Red String Of Fate.
339	"The idea, in a nutshell, is that a red thread connects two destined soulmates to one another across space and time."
340	The Naruto franchise provides great symbolism of that legend in The Last: Naruto The Movie for Naruto and Hinata through scarves.
341	"Hinata knits a scarf for Naruto as a gift, but chickens out of giving it to him when she sees he's already wearing a scarf."
342	"His scarf ends up tangled around both of them when they're caught in a genjutsu, tying them together to relive their memories and allowing Naruto to see himself the way Hinata sees him."
343	It's a heartwarming sequence that allows him to finally realize how much they've always loved one another.
344	Naruto And Hinata Can Understand One Another's Loneliness
345	"In the Naruto series, few of the young shinobi have happy childhoods."
346	"Their lives are marred by war, the pressure to succeed, and lost family members."
347	"While Naruto loses his family in the Nine-Tails' attack on the village when he's born, Hinata is ostracized by her family because she's not an aggressively adept ninja."
348	"Though they both have their teams as friends, they're also both incredibly isolated from most of their peers until they're all banding together in the lead-up to the Fourth Shinobi World War."
349	"Naruto and Hinata, despite the franchise not dwelling on it, live childhoods of loneliness."
350	They can understand one another's desire to be accepted as a result.
351	Their Relationship Allows Them To Have The Family Life They Missed Out On
352	"Because Naruto and Hinata both endured that isolation and loneliness in their own childhoods, they can apply their understanding of one another to their own children."
353	"Hinata doesn't continue life as an active shinobi once she becomes a mother, though Naruto does go on to become Hokage."
354	"Instead, Hinata makes sure that her children have a life full of encouragement and love, and Naruto does everything he can to make sure his family stays safe and intact."
355	Their childhood experiences shape the kind of parents they become and see them strive to have a happy family life as adults.
356	"Though the character of Hinata Hyuuga didnt debut in the Naruto manga until the fourth volume, she was a mainstay in the animated projects, appearing in every incarnation of the anime and movies."
357	"Eventually, the meek and mild girl who admired Naruto Uzumaki from afar became the love of his life  though many fans never would have imagined that possible during their early interactions."
358	Hinatas interest in Naruto wasnt born of romantic infatuation.
359	"Instead, she admired his commitment to training: no matter how many mistakes he made he always continued on in his missions."
360	She looked to find a way to stand up for herself the same way Naruto did.
361	"With nearly 500 episodes of anime in the two original Naruto series, and several movies as companion stories, the two fell in love, but for fans who might not have devoured every aspect of the Naruto canon, there's a lot to learn about their relationship."
362	Family lineage is an important part of just how the shinobi world works in the Naruto franchise.
363	"That's because a lot of specialty jutsu, and even chakra levels, are inherited."
364	"Each clan in the Naruto world has its own specialty, some of them are kept secret from outsiders, and most often, children end up in the clan of the father if distant relatives don't keep their relationships in the same clan."
365	"Because Naruto is said to be the last of the Uzumakis (though Karin is still out there and shares his clan name), Boruto and Himawari might share his family name, but they belong to the Hyuga clan."
366	Boruto and his little sister even train with their Aunt Hanabi once in a while.
367	"Considering Himawari has the Hyuga Byakugan, it makes perfect sense for her to maintain membership in her mother's clan anyway."
368	"When the Infinite Tsukuyomi was unleashed during the Fourth World War, the only ones not caught in the genjutsu were Sasuke, Sakura, and Naruto, as they were left to free the shinobi world."
369	"The genjutsu wasn't just a hallucination, however, it was meant to suck those affected by it into their ideal world."
370	"For Hinata, that world included Naruto."
371	"In fact, her dream is a relatively simple one at the time."
372	"She and Naruto spend time together, sitting on a bench, while her cousin Neji and her sister Hanabi witness how in love they are."
373	The three most important people in the world to her are safe and happy.
374	"She doesn't entirely get that dream to come true as Neji is killed in the way, but Naruto does eventually realize he feels the same."
375	"Naruto, the charmer and free spirit, is canonically a Libra in the franchise with his October 10th birthday."
376	"Hinata, on the other hand, is born on December 27th, making her a practical and goal-oriented Capricorn."
377	"On paper, Naruto and Hinata's zodiac signs make them one of the least compatible couples."
378	Astrology enthusiasts will know that both Libra and Capricorn tend to be leaders.
379	Hinata doesn't always show her leadership abilities in the series until she's forced to take a stand.
380	"Naruto takes the lead on a regular basis, whether others want him to or not."
381	"In theory, that should make them clash."
382	"Hinata, however, admires Naruto too much for that to happen when they're growing up."
383	"Capricorns also tend to see things in black-and-white, favoring one side of a situation."
384	"Libras are the zodiac sign most likely to understand both sides of an argument, making them effective peacemakers."
385	"All of these different traits could put them at odds on paper, but Hinata and Naruto don't let their differences stop them from growing together."
386	"Hinata and Naruto might have taken a long time to get on the same page as a couple, but once they did, they both wanted to make the other person comfortable in the relationship."
387	"According to one of the Naruto companion books, the Naruto Official Movie Guidebook, Naruto, who had no experience dating, decided to get a hand from Sai."
388	"Sai, raised in Root to ignore his own emotions, had books on human behavior to help him reintegrate into society."
389	It was there that Naruto learned he should be the one to pay on a date with Hinata.
390	He took her to a fancy restaurant for one of their first official dates but didn't anticipate exactly how much it would cost.
391	"Luckily, Hinata could see through his predicament - literally and figuratively."
392	"When she realizes that Naruto is slightly uncomfortable at their date location, she uses her Byakugan to take a peek into his wallet, noting that the restaurant is definitely out of their price range."
393	"She suggests the two go to Icihiraku Ramen instead, a staple in the series, and Naruto's favorite place."
394	"Naruto and Hinata might be beloved by a large number of the audience, but they actually aren't the most popular couple in the Naruto franchise."
395	It's easy to see which couple is the most popular by checking out fandom works on sites like Archive Of Our Own.
396	"Fans can search relationship tags, and the number of works for each relationship is listed."
397	"Across sites that catalog fandom works, there are a couple of pairings that stand out as much more popular."
398	"Canonically, the most popular couple is actually Sasuke and Sakura."
399	"Fanfiction, fanart, and cosplay for the two are prolific in the online community."
400	"The most popular couple that doesn't occur in canon also features Sasuke, but not Sakura."
401	It's the relationship between Sasuke and Naruto.
402	"Though both the Naruto manga and anime series begin with the title character already entrenched in ninja training and knowing all of the other supporting characters, the movies have fleshed out much of their backstory."
403	"In The Last: Naruto the Movie, fans got to see just how Naruto and Hinata met."
404	"In the middle of a snowy street, Hinata found herself the target of a group of bullies."
405	"The boys called Hinata a monster because of her Byakugan eyes, tormenting her while she cried, and that was when Naruto stepped in."
406	"Naruto, too young to have had any of the training seen later in the series, stands up to the three other boys and is beaten soundly for it."
407	"In fact, Naruto winds up unconscious, and its his actions attempting to save her that first cause Hinata to admire his courage."
408	"Neither of them has the skills necessary to stop the bullies at that point, but the two go on to train for the rest of their childhoods, saving one another repeatedly."
409	"Hinata might spend much of her formative years being saved by Naruto and other friends, but she grows into a fighter just as strong as him."
410	One of the many similarities Hinata and Naruto share is that they didnt have the easiest childhood.
411	"Though their experiences were different in many ways, their rough upbringing drew them to one another."
412	Narutos childhood was more brutal than most.
413	"With the spirit of a demon sealed inside his body, the majority of his village looked at him as an outsider and a threat."
414	"Add to that the fact that he lost his parents and had no other family to help him, and Naruto lived a life of isolation and loneliness."
415	"He spent much of his time acting out, being the most vocal one in the room, and drawing attention to himself."
416	"While Hinata grew up with her family, her childhood was just as difficult."
417	"She was the heir to the Hyuga Clan, a prominent ninja family."
418	"More gentle than the rest of her family, she didnt take well to their difficult training regimen."
419	"Her father was also hard on her, criticizing her timid personality and pushing her to change her ways."
420	"The more he drilled his own ideas into her head though, the further Hinata shrunk into herself."
421	"Unlike Naruto, who longed to stand out on his own terms, Hinata tried to make herself blend in."
422	The two grew to balance one another out.
423	Hinata spent much of her childhood with everyone telling her that she wasnt strong enough to become a ninja.
424	"She spent a lot of time internalizing everyone elses opinion of her, allowing their ideas to influence how she acted in a confrontation, losing every fight as a result."
425	Naruto was the first one to have any faith in her abilities.
426	"When Hinata was selected to battle her cousin Neji in the chunin exams, none of the other ninjas in training believed she has what it took to beat him."
427	Neji spent the entirety of the match talking down to her and reminding her that shes not as powerful as him.
428	"Its only Naruto, watching from the sidelines, who cheers Hinata on and has faith in her."
429	"Narutos faith in her keeps her from backing down, and its the first time she stands her ground in a fight instead of giving up, surprising all of those who have trained with her."
430	"When Hinata is introduced in both the manga and the anime, her hair is cut very short compared to the other female characters, and especially the characters in her own family."
431	The reasoning here is twofold.
432	"In ancient Japanese culture, when a woman brought disgrace to their family, they were made to cut their hair."
433	"Hinatas father, who considered her a failure as his heir to the main house of the clan Hyuuga, essentially disowned her and placed her little sister in line to run the clan one day."
434	Fans have theorized that he made Hinata cut her hair short before he washed his hands of her.
435	"On the other hand, theres another reason that links back to her romantic interest as well."
436	"In the manga, its revealed that Sasuke has a thing for long hair, and so many of the girls attending the Academy want to get his attention that they spend a lot of time styling their long hair."
437	"To show that Sasuke isnt the one who holds her attention, Hinatas hair is cropped short."
438	Its a subtle way of making sure Naruto knows she isnt interested in someone else.
439	"As the manga (and the anime) series grew, Hinatas hair became longer over time."
440	"Not only did this mark her growing up and growing closer to Naruto, but it also marked her learning not to place stock in what other people thought of her."
441	"During the Fourth Shinobi World War in the manga, the ninjas that readers watched grow up were put into even more perilous situations than usual."
442	The anime did the same.
443	"It wasnt all massive battles, though."
444	There were also some pretty interesting schemes in hopes of getting residents of the Hidden Leaf Village to reveal their secrets.
445	"One arc, in particular, saw Zetsu imitate many of the beloved characters."
446	"Zetsu were, for all intents and purposes, shapeshifting walking zombies."
447	"The Zetsu used to be ninjas with distinct personalities, but their lives were lost during experiments that left them as part of the mystical god tree."
448	They were able to emerge from it and masquerade as others.
449	Hinata was one of them.
450	The chief way the Zetsu decided to convince residents of the village that it was Hinata?
451	That would be by making it very clear just how much affection she held for Naruto.
452	"Eventually, her teammates figured it out, but Kiba couldnt resist teasing her that the biggest secret the Zetsu almost got was how much Hinata cared about Naruto."
453	The addition of the Zetsu to the confrontation made everyone in the battles suspicious of who could be friend or foe.
454	"After Hinata was impersonated by one, she was also attacked by others."
455	"Naruto saved her from the attack, but her friends werent so sure he was the real Naruto."
456	"Instead, her cousin Neji insisted that the Naruto that saved her and joined their ranks could be a Zetsu trying to earn their trust."
457	"Hinata, however, disagreed."
458	"According to Hinata, all she had to do was look into Narutos eyes to know it was him."
459	"Throughout the arc, that idea became a recurring theme for the two."
460	"Hinata believed that, even with her special power of sight, it was Narutos eyes that would tell her the truth."
461	"Naruto echoed the sentiment later: he could always see the truth in Hinata, which was sweet but didnt help him when people suspected him of being a shapeshifter."
462	Hinata spent some time apologizing not only for others mistrusting him but also for Naruto having to deal with the suspicion.
463	The arc ended up being resolved with the help of both Naruto and Hinata.
464	Narutos ability to see through things and Hinatas eyes combined helped them both come to the truth about what was happening.
465	"The story of the two who fell in love in a world filled with political intrigue, battles, and internal struggle still captivated fans even years after the manga finished."
466	"That said, the shows ending didnt completely resolve everything."
467	"Naruto and Hinata had a brief break from the ninja life to enjoy some romance, but the series epilogue and Naruto Gaiden that followed revealed the two were well into their married life."
468	"The sequel series, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, also carries on their story with their children, but the rest of their romantic saga isnt fully revealed."
469	"Fans of Hinata and Naruto might not have had their perfect ending yet, but they have watched as the two grew up and became the couple everyone dreamed they would be."
