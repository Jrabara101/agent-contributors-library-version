“The energy here in the Philippines is amazing. We all know that Axie and the Philippines are inexplicably linked, we grew up together. The energy from the community is super strong, it’s been a hard time for the crypto (and) web3 space recently but, being honest, being here really allows us to push forward and gain that strength that we need,” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“Now (we have) thousands of really strong supporters, community members, cheering us on. It’s amazing, it’s a totally different feeling and it gives me a lot of hope for the future,” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“weren’t sure about the COVID restrictions in Manila”|https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“But of course, future big events like that in the Philippines will definitely make a lot of sense,” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“I am incredibly proud of the team… we’ve been waiting for this moment for 3, 4 years because we always knew that the Philippines would be the center of blockchain gaming, metaverse, and web3. It’s only a matter of time before the rest of the world will see that as well,” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“there is nothing like seeing your competition face-to-face”|https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“Now, we are the ones where the people are coming into. We are now the ones where the world is going to visit, challenge, and compete against. And that is just a great feeling,” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“I don’t think the market cycle really matters as much. I think what matters is if the game is ready, if the community is ready, if the industry is ready. I think it does not matter so much what the prices are. It’s great nga that we can continue to enjoy events like this even (though) crypto prices are not great as they were before.” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
“I want to shout out the Philippines, the entire week has been so emotional to me. It really feels surreal to see how strong our community is here. You see the numbers, you see the headlines, you watch the documentary, but everyone in the Axie Community needs to know how intense the hype is here. These have been hard times for crypto, hard times for web3, hard times for Axie but coming here gives us the strength to understand what we’re building for, who we’re building for, where we’re going; we need to keep pushing.” https://bitpinas.com/feature/axie-open-manila-recap-jeff-zirlin-luis-buenaventura-interview/
